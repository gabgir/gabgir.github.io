title: TMUX — super utility for the SSH user
---

So you are SSH’ing into your remote machine, running commands after
commands, and suddenly realized you could use another terminal session.
On your local machine, nothing easier, but in this case, you would need
to open another SSH session. Painful? Not really, but it could be
easier.


This is where [TMUX](https://tmux.github.io) comes in really handy.
TMUX, as its names states, is a Terminal Multiplexer.


You can install it on linux using:

```
pi@raspberry$ sudo apt-get install tmux
```

Or on macOS using [brew](https://brew.sh/):

```
$ brew install tmux
```


So once logged into your remote machine, you can simply call it:

```
pi@raspberry$ tmux
```

And you get and empty terminal window, with a status bar at the bottom.

Then you can go on with your business as usual. The instant you require
an another terminal session, no need to create a new SSH session, simply
do:

For a new window:

```
ctrl+b then c
```

for a new session, vertically split in the same window:

```
ctrl+b then %
```

For a new session, horizontally split in the same window:

```
ctrl+b then “
```

So your SSH session can end up looking like this:

You can see the window session listed in the status bar. in this
screenshot, there are 2 window sessions, both running bash currently. To
switch we can simply hit:

```
ctrl+b then <window session number>
```

### But wait, there is more!

TMUX also allows you to “detach” the session and close your SSH session
without killing any running commands using:

ctrl+b then d

Next time you open a SSH session again to your remote machine, you can
run:

```
pi@raspberry$ tmux ls
```

to list existing session and:

```
pi@raspberry$ tmux attach -t <session name>
```

to “attach” the tmux session to your your current SSH session and dive
back in.

### Tell me more!

In fact, TMUX can do so much more and can be configured and customized
extensively. Have a look at this [cheat
sheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com) or at this guide on [configuring
your .tmux.conf](http://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/).
