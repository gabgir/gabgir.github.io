title: Why you should build yourself a linux server
---

There are cases where you need a PC to be running at all times. For example, you might be using [Plex](http://plex.tx) to stream your music, tv shows and films accross all your devices. Or maybe you are using [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com) to host your own digital library. You could leave your main machine running, but what if it is a laptop that you need to carry with you at work or school? You need a different machine. In my case, I ended up using an old pc I had laying around. But I replaced that machine because it was old, slow and outdated. So as it was (an old windows PC with 2GB of ram) it wouldn't support most of the apps I wanted on it.

That is where Linux comes in. Even recent versions of Linux can run on low end specs machines. There is a variety of distributions of Linux to pick from, but for low specs, something like [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me) is great. I won't go through the installation process, the official [documentation](https://docs.lubuntu.net/lubuntu_installation) is quite clear and simple.

Alright, let's say you got your linux up and running. What can or should you do now? Well you could turn it in a headless (no screen, no keyboard, no mouse) server by enabling SSH connection and VNC on it (check out this [guide](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/RemoteDesktop) to get started). Then, there is a bunch of great softwares you could install on it:

- [Plex](http://plex.tv) to share your media across your network
- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com) to build your own digital library
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/streaming/) to stream your games on your network (if your machine is powerful enough)
- [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com) to run your torrent downloads.
- [OwnCloud](https://owncloud.org) to have your own, locally run, dropbox like cloud.
- [Minecraft](https://www.linuxnorth.org/minecraft/linux.html) to run a minecraft server available to all on your network. Nerd party time!

That is a short list, there are plenty more cool apps you could install. You could even build and run your own website. Hopefully this give you ideas to get started. In future blog posts, we will explore some of those apps and all we can set it all up together.
